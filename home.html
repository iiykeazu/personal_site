  <p id = "aboutme" > I am a graduate of the University of Maryland. I studied and obtained my
    bachelors degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. My professional interests are in graph theory
    and the applications of machine learning. Personally I enjoy reading, drawing, playing video games,
    meeting new people, and traveling. I hope to use this site as a medium to share
    my experiences, projects, and my thoughts on books, music and other works of art.
